## Material Design Icons

The enhancement, appearance and compatibility section icons use Google's
[Material Design Icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons), pinned
to commit `0cbb08816df07faaae3dca060d4ebb10b66c214f`:

- `src/image/auto_fix_high/materialicons/24px.svg`
- `src/image/palette/materialicons/24px.svg`
- `src/action/extension/materialicons/24px.svg`

The SVG paths were converted to Android VectorDrawable resources with their
original 24-by-24 geometry. Non-drawing SVG bounds were omitted, and the fill is
white so the existing theme tint can be applied. No icon font or runtime library
is included. Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0; the complete upstream
license is provided in `third_party/MaterialDesignIcons-LICENSE.txt`.

## AndroidLiquidGlass

The experimental Liquid skin contains an Android View/Drawable adaptation of the
rounded-rectangle refraction shader from
[Kyant0/AndroidLiquidGlass](https://github.com/Kyant0/AndroidLiquidGlass), based on
upstream commit `65ab177e90e5c1d8c62e70cf7755841982da65f6`.

Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. The complete license text is
provided in `third_party/AndroidLiquidGlass-LICENSE.txt`.

The adapted implementation has been changed to use Android Views and Drawables,
an Activity-scoped static Monet backdrop source, bounded bitmap storage, explicit
API-level backends, and the module's own lifecycle and recovery protocol. It does
not include the upstream Compose Multiplatform component or rendering framework.

## AndroidLiquidGlassView

The Liquid skin also adapts the safe rounded-rectangle gradient and linear-sRGB
color treatment from
[QmDeve/AndroidLiquidGlassView](https://github.com/QmDeve/AndroidLiquidGlassView),
version `1.0.5`.

The module keeps its existing Activity-scoped static underlay, bounded bitmap,
Drawable integration, API 31 blur fallback, API 27 translucent fallback, and
renderer recovery protocol. It does not include the upstream View component or
its per-frame View-tree recording implementation.

## Markwon

The module uses
[Markwon](https://github.com/noties/Markwon), version `4.6.2`, to parse GitHub
Release Markdown and render it as Android-native `Spanned` text. Only the core
artifact is included; HTML, image loading, WebView, syntax highlighting and
other optional extensions are not included.

## DexKit

The module uses
[DexKit](https://github.com/LuckyPray/DexKit), version `2.2.0`, only as a
background fallback for bounded host DEX adaptation queries. DexKit is not
created from the synchronous `quickLocate` path or any installed Hook callback,
and each bridge is closed immediately after its query.
